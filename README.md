## Priority 

### Current Issues

- Platforms
- Due to the change in item a class may need to be created for Item. This way you can get the index,
of the texture region it uses when calling to the axis. 
- Vertical wall bug. You can land on the side of top of wall vertically stacking with one another,
due to the way the future bound is used. 
-Chest need a loot table and so do stores and Item Rooms (but for that I may need more items



### Backburner (Broad goals that need to be broken down once we reach them)

- Biggablobba needs a phase where he goes underground and chases the player 
- Larger map on tap 
- Pause 
- Sound both effects and music 
- Repaint doors if they lead to a special room 
- Enemies that summon other enemies should be minions and should not drop look 
- New Enemies 
    - Has a block shield that needs to be destroyed 
    - A stamp from above (possibly in the foundary?) Red hot crusher plate 
    - Spike balls that bounce off walls 
    - Enemy that shoots out a cone of bullets 0 degrees 45 degrees and -45 degrees. 
    
- New Items 
    - Items generally need to toned down to give more minor increases to stats 
    - If you have an item it should be removed from the pool of items that can be generated 
    - Items that reveal the map and change your weapon 
    
- Time Limit to complete the game, if you run out of time you die. (Casual game mode if you do not want to do that)

- New Bosses 
    - Prince and Princess box for a face. Two enemies that when one dies the other tries to ressurect
    - Giant KugelDusche enemy that the player has to traverse of moving planks to hit. 
    
- Explosives and Lasers
