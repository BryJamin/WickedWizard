Let's see how far I get in 8 months using an hour per day

#Next Steps

I want to focus on adding in the vertical movement (current idea is to use grappling hook).

This also involves creating fall through platforms. (An idea would be if you click a platform above you, you grapple up to it, if you click the ground below you, you fall through the platform. 

Once I have eradicated the need for transition arrows I can then focus on adding different preset layouts and enemies to rooms. 

Once that's that I can then focus on items and upgrading the character as you go through the map. 

The next port of call will be generating a second map once you beat the boss.
