Let's see how far I get in 8 months using an hour per day

#Things to do 


- Menu 

- Stages

- The whole damn game

#Things to do next 

- Add animations to the wizard character 

- Add 2 different 'battle rooms' One with blobs that spawn on both sides, One with two turrets on both side. When the enemies are dead give a prompt to move the next screen.

- Add a crappy background so my eyes aren't blinded by red all the time 

- Fire rate, tapping should also fire bullets not just holding down 

- Health bar so I know when my character is going to die

- Try to find any uncesscarry System print lns

- Decided on how ammo resources are going to work. - Redacted? I don't thing there is going to be ammo anymore

-  Add another projectile type that arcs and on land explodes - Done

- Figure out how to do death animations for enemies and bullets. - Done

- Make it so, when you click in the 'deck' area you don't fire any bullets - Done

- Enemy blinks when hit - Done

- Add in enemy projectiles and the dispelling feature. (Dispelling enemy projectiles) - Done

#Overall Goal 

##I want the wizard to feel powerful to the point where they can go through the game without being hit.
##Everything can be avoided. 

#27 11 2016 - Update

The game is now taking on a different form. Since the player is static the only way to move is in theory just going to be other static positions. This means if a laser is aimed at one are a player can teleport to the other static area and avoid the blast. 

The game is headed towards a more structed approach. There will be pre-determined rooms that have a set of enemies within them that the player must defeat to continue. 

Also, the idea of brining in different cards is started to wane on me as a developer. Because it might be easier to just the buff the shtos of the player instead of having the player choosing from an array of different cards. From a development standpoint it might be better as this is a started project to have a more simple player-world interaction. By this I means some games have a set movement for the character and then build the game about what they expect the character to be able to do. If for the most part my character can shoot in the straight line then I don't need to worry about if a player would decide to only pick 'arcing' weapons and other things. Or which weapon is over-powered vs another weapon. The player just has one weapon and it gets buffed. Therefore there can be a forced cap on a players power and if the player feels too weak I can raise the cap. 

I'm reminded of games like megaman where you cna go through the whole game just as the blue bomber and the other power ups are buffs instead of mandatory. 

I wouold also like to add boss type rooms where the player need to try and beat a boss (how you make a boss I don't really know).

#Previous Update

The current aim that is being decided upon is whether or not you can choose the number of spells you bring with you. 
Like can you bring 5 fire spells or are you locked into multiple types of spells. 

I thing with this is, that if you can bring 5 fire spells then if you wanted to you could add in specialization 'talents'

Like if you go into the fire specialization you do bonus fire damage etc. 

The issue with that would be balancing, but it's a single wizard game so hmm.. For example, if fire spec is way better
than the other specs for beating the game. Also, you have to make it so all specs are capable of beating the game. 

Since the wizard is essentially a turret that depending on the enviroment can teleport to different locations there are only so
many ways to make the wizard feel like they are in danger.

The ideas I currently have are something like this. 

- Projectiles fire at the players. 

If I give players the ability to freely teleport or 'dash' there would need to be a cooldown of sorts so the wizard can actually get hit.

I also wanted to add the ability to 'dispell' some projectiles by swiping the screen in the direction of the projectiles. 

You can also dodge projectiles by 'teleporting to save locations. 

- Enemies Walk towards the wizard

This is the other one, enemies who can't shoot need to walk closer to get some action in. 

The wizard can either defeat them before they get closer or knock them back if they get too close.

It really is a tricky thing
