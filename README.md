# WickedWizard
Let's see how far I get in 8 months using an hour per day

#Overall Goal 

##I want the wizard to feel powerful to the point where they can go through the game without being hit.
##Everything can be avoided. 

The current aim that is being decided upon is whether or not you can choose the number of spells you bring with you. 
Like can you bring 5 fire spells or are you locked into multiple types of spells. 

I thing with this is, that if you can bring 5 fire spells then if you wanted to you could add in specialization 'talents'

Like if you go into the fire specialization you do bonus fire damage etc. 

The issue with that would be balancing, but it's a single wizard game so hmm.. For example, if fire spec is way better
than the other specs for beating the game. Also, you have to make it so all specs are capable of beating the game. 

Since the wizard is essentially a turret that depending on the enviroment can teleport to different locations there are only so
many ways to make the wizard feel like they are in danger.

The ideas I currently have are something like this. 

- Projectiles fire at the players. 

If I give players the ability to freely teleport or 'dash' there would need to be a cooldown of sorts so the wizard can actually get hit.

I also wanted to add the ability to 'dispell' some projectiles by swiping the screen in the direction of the projectiles. 

You can also dodge projectiles by 'teleporting to save locations. 

- Enemies Walk towards the wizard

This is the other one, enemies who can't shoot need to walk closer to get some action in. 

The wizard can either defeat them before they get closer or knock them back if they get too close.

It really is a tricky thing
